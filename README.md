# Le Tip

## 🚀 Getting started

These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### 📋 Prerequisites

To run the application you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your local environment.

### 🔧 Installation

Open the terminal, go to the directory where you usually leave your projects and execute the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/adejota/le-tip.git
$ cd le-tip
$ npm install

```

All setup, easy like that! You should see a message like this on your terminal:
```
App running at:
- Local:   http://localhost:8080/
```

## ⚙️ Building for production

In the same directory you were in the previous step, run the following command:
```

And we are done!
